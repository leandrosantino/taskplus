# TaskPlus

This project was created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), with the aim of studying this technology. The app's purpose is to create and edit tasks, as well as share them, like in a social network.

Building this application allowed me to not only study Nextjs itself, but also: the different methods of social authentication, understand how JsonWebToken works, practice my skills with HTML and CSS, as well as improve my programming logic with TypeScript.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
  npm run dev
  # or
  yarn dev
  # or
  pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
